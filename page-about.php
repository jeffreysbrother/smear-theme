      <p class="text-muted">My name is James Cool. I'm usually interested in music, and I'm sometimes interested in philosophy. I've also recently picked up programming and photography.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">In terms of programming, I am focusing primarily on web development. This site was built using Bootstrap, PHP, Grunt, and a bit of Sass. I've also utilized an image gallery by <a href="https://github.com/blueimp" target="_blank">Sebastian Tschan</a>, and some icon fonts by <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Dave Gandy</a>. After publishing the site, and after realizing the utility of a database-driven blog, I decided to convert the existing layout into a WordPress theme. I'm currently using a number of online resources, including <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> to learn about WordPress and related technologies.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">In philosophy, I am mostly interested in belief and justification. I occasionally find myself fiddling with an epistemological model that treats truth as subjective evaluation of accuracy, belief as a suspicion of this accuracy, and knowledge as nothing beyond either a feeling of certainty or an expression of a retroactive evaluation (classifying some <em>prior</em> judgment as veridical after obtaining confirmation). My view of art is that the concept is relatively useless. My general outlook is empiricist, nominalistic, and fallibilistic in nature. Abstract entities and moral laws, I think, are genuine fictions. Belief appears involuntary, determinism false. There are judgments, emotional responses, and actions; a lot of silliness comes from ignoring the differences between them and by failing to grasp the difference between practical and theoretical reasoning.</p>
